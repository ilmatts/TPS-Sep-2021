Kaggle Tabular Playground Series Sept 2021 Submission for Digital Futures Data Science Academy

The aim of this project was to take part in and complete the Kaggle "Tabular Playground Series - Sep 2021" Prediction Competition. The competition consisted of predicting the probability of a customer making a claim on an insurance policy. I chose this as my capstone project since it allowed me to put my knowledge and skills into practice but also explore new topics and learn new modelling techniques. 

The best solution I was able to achieve consisted of a voting classifier model containing the three highest-scoring available models I was able to train on my dataset. This solution was able to achieve good predictive performance both in-sample and out-of-sample, with AUC scores in excess of 83% when using the entire dataset to predict labels for the validation dataset. Other metrics scored highly as well, indicating the good performance of the chosen model. 

The project was concluded with the submission of the test predictions to the relevant competition submission page to finally  be scored. My best predictions allowed me to score in the top 37% of participants.
