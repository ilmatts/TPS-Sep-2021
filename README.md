Kaggle Tabular Playground Series Sept 2021 Submission for Digital Futures Data Science Academy. 

The challenge description and data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-sep-2021

The "Kaggle Tabular Playground Series Sept 2021" notebook contains all code and all models tested (but not run due to insufficient memory) while the "Capstone" notebook contains the code and outputs of the best performing model.

## Project Aims
The aim of this project was to take part in and complete the Kaggle "Tabular Playground Series - Sep 2021" Prediction Competition. The competition consisted of predicting the probability of a customer making a claim on an insurance policy. I chose this as my capstone project since it allowed me to put my knowledge and skills into practice but also explore new topics and learn new modelling techniques. 

## Methods
The best solution I was able to achieve consisted of a voting classifier model containing the three highest-scoring available models I was able to train on my dataset. This solution was able to achieve good predictive performance both in-sample and out-of-sample, with AUC scores in excess of 83% when using the entire dataset to predict labels for the validation dataset. Other metrics scored highly as well, indicating the good performance of the chosen model. 

## Conclusion
The project was concluded with the submission of the test predictions to the relevant competition submission page to finally  be scored. My best submission was able to achieve an AUC score of 0.81481 on Kaggle's test dataset, allowing me to score in the top 37% of participants in the final standings and only 0.0029 lower than the top-scoring competitor.

## Further plans
Taking into consideration the limitations faced, the main improvement that could be made would be the availability of additional computing power, both in terms of processing speed and memory. That would not only speed up current models but also allow the experimentation of additional models and techniques that could not be carried out in this project. The use of more complex and powerful models could have provided better performance scores and improved the AUC score achievable on the test dataset.

The positive result obtained from the September challenge persuaded me to participate in the October and November competitions, the latter of which is still in progress at the time of writing.
